# rust-automata-regexp-machine

This is the output of my journey learning the Automata theory (NFA and DFA) to understand how RegExp machine work internally. It was fully based on the [Automata Theory: inside a RegExp machine course
](https://www.udemy.com/course/automata-theory-building-a-regexp-machine) by Dmitry Soshnikov who I am very grateful for such incredible course.
